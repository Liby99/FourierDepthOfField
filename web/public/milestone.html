                <h2>Space Escape: Overview</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In this final project, we are planning to make a room escape game that is
                        plotted in a space station. The player is now stucked in a space station
                        that is about to explode, and the player need to move around in the
                        zero-gravity space to find a way out. The main interaction lies in the
                        travel where the player cannot simply walk around but the only way to
                        move is by using some handle to pull oneself towards the target. The player
                        also need to carefully look at the surroundings to find clues for the
                        escape. For example the tools to light up the scene, keys to open some
                        holder, as well as the interaction with very high tech computers.

                <h2>Technical Features</h2>
                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Selection & Manipulation (2 pts)</h4>
                            <p>
                                Since we are aiming at giving a immersive experience of space,
                                we are going to use the simpliest virtual hand methods to grab
                                and manipulate the objects. There are mainly two things we need
                                to select: the first one is just any movable objects in the scene
                                like keys, cards and boxes, while the second one is the handles for
                                the user to move, which we will address in the next section.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Wayfinding (1 pt)</h4>
                            <p>
                                We still need wayfinding because, since we are making a puzzle game,
                                it is possible that the player need to have some hint for what is
                                the next thing they need to find. So we will give wayfinding aid
                                when the user press the "menu" button on the Oculus Touch
                                Controller.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Travel (2 pts)</h4>
                            <p>
                                We are not going to use traditional travel methods since we are
                                working in a space station. The way we want the users to travel is
                                by giving them grabbable handles for them to fix themselves, pull
                                or push to get accelerations, or even push the wall to move away
                                from the wall. We are going to make the experience as close to the
                                no-gravity space as possible.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Symbolic Input (2 pts)</h4>
                            <p>
                                We are also very interested in making high-tech computers in the
                                room, while the user need to input some specific thing to move
                                forward the game. The specific use case is not decided yet but we
                                are sure that the interaction is going to be very interesting.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Spatial Audio (1 pt)</h4>
                            <p>
                                We really do want this feature because, why not. To make a seamless
                                experience of a space room escape, the audio is necessary.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Note: We might add or remove any feature as our development goes on.

                        In the creative effort, beside the plot (a exploding space station) and the
                        creative technical effort, we are mainly going to put our hands on designing
                        some interesting puzzles and make really good models (scene). Both of us are
                        hardcore puzzle game players and we do have some great ideas in terms of
                        designing the puzzles. While we also have some modeling experience and we
                        really want to design the scene one our own.
